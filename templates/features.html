        <h1> Donate Blood</h1>

     <p> A quick, safe, and selfless act that saves lives 
         by providing blood for emergencies, surgeries,
         and patients with chronic illnesses.
         It helps build a healthier community 
         while offering benefits like free health check-ups
         and the joy of helping others. </p> 

         <h1> Search Donors</h1>

    <p> The "Search Donors" feature allows users to quickly find blood donors
        in their area based on blood type and location. This ensures faster responses during emergencies and 
        connects those in need with willing donors. It streamlines the process, saving valuable time 
        and making life-saving donations 
        more accessible and efficient. </p> 
        <h1> Request Blood</h1>

    <p>The "Request Blood" feature enables users to submit urgent blood requests directly through the website.

            blood banks, ensuring timely assistance during emergencies and critical situations. </p> 
            

        <h1>Exchange Blood</h1>

     <p>The "Exchange Blood" feature facilitates a mutual blood donation system, where users can exchange blood donations 
            with others in need. This feature allows individuals to offer blood in exchange for the type they require, promoting a 
            more efficient and reciprocal blood donation process within the community. </p> 
            

        <h1> Need Blood</h1>
